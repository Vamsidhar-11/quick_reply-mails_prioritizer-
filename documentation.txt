Here's a quick look at how I built this tool.

What It Is (The Parts)
A Website: I made a simple website that acts as our main dashboard to see all the support emails in one place.

A Gmail Link: The site securely connects to a Gmail account to find messages from customers asking for help.


How It Thinks (My Approach)
My main goal was to make sure the AI gives good, accurate answers.

So, before the AI writes anything, I make it read from a special folder of our own help files. This way, its answers are based on our real information, not just random stuff from the internet.

Most importantly, a person is always in charge. The AI only suggests a reply. You get to check it, make any changes you like, and then you are the one who clicks send.
